			Hi Everyone, my name is Nam Dam. I am a senior studying MIS. I moved to the US when 
			I was 14, so I have a mix of both Vietnamese and American culture. I enjoy reading,
			playing board-games, and I always take time alone to reflect on myself over the week.
			My most recent trip was to New York City for 4 days. I look forward to working with 
			everyone this semester.
